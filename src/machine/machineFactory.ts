/**
 * Create a **Software Delivery MachineConfiguration** with default predefined goals.
 * Combines commands and delivery event handling using _goals_.
 *
 * Goals and goal "implementations" can be defined by users.
 * However, certain well known goals are built into the DefaultSoftwareDeliveryMachine
 * for convenience, with their own associated listeners.
 *
 * Well known goal support is based around a delivery process spanning
 * common goals of fingerprinting, reacting to fingerprint diffs,
 * code review, build, deployment, endpoint verification and
 * promotion to a production environment.
 *
 * The most important element of a software delivery machine is setting
 * zero or more _push rules_ in the constructor.
 * This is normally done using the internal DSL as follows:
 *
 * ```
 * const sdm = createSoftwareDeliveryMachine(
 *    "MyMachine",
 *    options,
 *    whenPushSatisfies(IsMaven, HasSpringBootApplicationClass, not(MaterialChangeToJavaRepo))
 *      .itMeans("No material change to Java")
 *      .setGoals(NoGoals),
 *    whenPushSatisfies(ToDefaultBranch, IsMaven, HasSpringBootApplicationClass, HasCloudFoundryManifest)
 *      .itMeans("Spring Boot service to deploy")
 *      .setGoals(HttpServiceGoals));
 * ```
 *
 * Uses the builder pattern to allow fluent construction. For example:
 *
 * ```
 * softwareDeliveryMachine
 *    .addPushReaction(async pu => ...)
 *    .addNewIssueListener(async i => ...)
 *    .add...;
 * ```
