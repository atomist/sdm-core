Core implementation of the software delivery machine (SDM) API for
production deployments.

Software delivery machines enable you to control your delivery process
in code.  Think of it as an API for your software delivery.  See the
[Atomist documentation][atomist-doc] for more information on the
concept of a software delivery machine and how to create and develop
an SDM.
